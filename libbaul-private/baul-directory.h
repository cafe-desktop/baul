/* BaulDirectory is a class that manages the model for a directory,
   real or virtual, for Baul, mainly the file-manager component. The directory is
   responsible for managing both real data and cached metadata. On top of
   the file system independence provided by gio, the directory
   object also provides:

       1) A synchronization framework, which notifies via signals as the
          set of known files changes.
       2) An abstract interface for getting attributes and performing
          operations on files.
