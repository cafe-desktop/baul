  Baul is an open-source file manager and graphical shell being
  developed by Eazel, Inc. and others. It is part of the CAFE project, and its
  source code can be found in the CAFE CVS repository. Baul is still in
  the early stages of development. It will become an integral part of the
  CAFE desktop environment when it is finished.
